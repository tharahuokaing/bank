# Huokaing Thara Banking System (Educational Project)

## Overview

Huokaing Thara Banking System is a simulated enterprise-style banking frontend architecture designed for **educational and research purposes only**.

This project demonstrates:

- Secure bootloader architecture
- Modular phase-based system design
- Authentication flow with session management
- 2FA-ready login structure
- Role-based dashboard rendering
- SOC-style monitoring simulation
- Stress test module structure
- Phase registry and execution framework

---

## ⚠️ Educational Use Only

This project:

- Is NOT a real banking system
- Does NOT process real financial transactions
- Does NOT connect to any real bank
- Does NOT implement production-grade cryptography
- Is NOT intended for commercial deployment

It is strictly created for:

- Learning system architecture
- Understanding frontend modular design
- Exploring secure boot patterns
- Studying authentication flows
- Academic demonstrations
- Personal experimentation

## Disclaimer

Huokaing Thara Banking System is a simulation project only.

The author assumes no responsibility for misuse, modification, or deployment of this code in real financial environments.

If you intend to build a real banking system, you must implement:

- Backend authentication
- Encrypted password storage
- TLS enforcement
- Secure API design
- Regulatory compliance
- Financial auditing standards
